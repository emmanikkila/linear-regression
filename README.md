# Linear Regression - WHO Life Expectancy

[Link to the Report](life_expectancy.ipynb)

## Aim of the Analysis
By using multiple linear regression model, the analysis looks into the relationship between life expectancy and various predicting factors in the dataset. The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:

- What kind of correlations do the predicting factors have with life expectancy? Are these correlations linear?
- Do these correlations differ when comparing developed and developing nations?
- Is multiple linear regression model an optimal and accurate tool for creating life expectancy predictions from the data?
